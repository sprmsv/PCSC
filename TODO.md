- One central executable that reads input

- Inline documentation of your code (Doxygen)

- Create Doxygen documentation

- Test suite

- Make a report delivered as an extended README:
    - how to compile the program
    - typical program execution (the flow) and usage
    - List of features & tests
    - TODOs and perspectives

- Make one oral presentation per student
    - the structure of the program
    - list of features

# Evaluation
- The code
    1. must be compiling
    2. different options are inputs (no need to recompile to change behavior)
    3. should be clean (coding convention)
    4. should have inline comments (and Doxygen)
    5. must pass tests
    6. The git log entries/comments must be understandable

- The report should describe:
    1. the implementation in a consise way
    2. the validating tests
    3. the limitations and problems


# MAIN TODOs

3. Implement custom vector/scalar methods with all the operators
4. Add other function classes
5. Show the Central Limit Theorem
?. Write output to files
6. Add assertions and custom exceptions
